cloudfoundry-liteclient-lib
===========================

A clone of the cloudfoundry-client-lib repository, but with all the huge Spring stuff removed, to allow eventual use within Android based projects.
Uses only Android-compatible HTTPClient and JSON code for all rest api calls, and OAuth token management.
The code is mostly functional, but not fully tested yet.
Any help would be greatly welcomed.
